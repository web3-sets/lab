# LaTeX

Nextra uses [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) to render LaTeX expressions directly in MDX.
To enable LaTeX support, you must add the following to your `next.config.js`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = require('nextra')({
  latex: true
})
```

Using LaTeX within MDX is as simple as wrapping your expression in `$$` or `$`. For example, the following code
```latex
$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
```
will be rendered as: $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

To learn more about KaTeX and its supported functions, visit their [documentation](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html).
